# Conway's game of life
Game of life also know as Life, is a cellular automation.
It's basically an infinite grid of cells and each cell can be either dead or alive.
The 3 simple rules this particular automation are:
- Every alive cell with less than 2 neighbors, dies in the next generation
- Every alive cell with more than 3 neighbors also dies in the next generation
- If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbors, it will become a live one

The rest of the cells stay as they were the previous generation.
